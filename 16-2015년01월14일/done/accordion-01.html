			<div>What is the origin of ChattingCat?</div>
			<div>April, the co-founder of ChattingCat, grew up in Korea but worked as a marketer in the US. April wrote English for many things: emails to customers, text on the company website, etc.

	To write “like a native speaker”, April hired a tutor and texted him her writing. The tutor sent corrections back immediately. Instant corrections helped April work efficiently and fast.

	April was convinced that instant correction of her mistakes helped her learn quickly. With instant correction, she could write, see mistakes and learn. With instant help, she felt confident writing, and wanted to write more.

	That’s how ChattingCat was born!
